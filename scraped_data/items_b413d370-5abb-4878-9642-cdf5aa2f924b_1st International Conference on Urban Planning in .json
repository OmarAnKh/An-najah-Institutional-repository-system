This paper will attempt to demonstrate and expose Israeli Occupation planning and building policies and uncover the systematic discrimination adopted and practiced against Arab-Palestinians. This discrimination is mainly manifested in the prejudiced zoning classifications of occupied East Jerusalem in favor of illegal Israeli-Jewish existence there to that of the Palestinian population,which include, among others: discrimination in building permits and regulations,confiscating and razing land, erecting and expanding illegal Israeli colonies and outposts, paving Israeli designated roads, demolishing Palestinian houses, and now excluding entire Arab-Palestinian communities with the Separation Wall.Furthermore, the paper will work on the delineation of de facto Israeli administrative changes of the demarcated Jerusalem City boundary set within the United Nations partition plan of November 29, 1947, where the City of Jerusalem comes under“Corpus Seperatum” status and is to be administered by a Special International Regime. The paper will also show the ramifications of the unilaterally and illegally imposed “new municipal boundaries” post the 1967 Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem, which is currently 10 time its original size, ending with the 2005 “Jerusalem2020 Master-plan.” Jerusalem, according to the Israeli adopted Masterplan-2020, has“NO AREA” for future Arab Jerusalemite development, with more than half of its total area already considered built-up area.
