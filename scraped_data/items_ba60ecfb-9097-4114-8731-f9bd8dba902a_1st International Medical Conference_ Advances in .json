The length and thickness of the long bones were reduced, with bowing and reduction in their endochondral ossification. Sirenomelia occurred in the group treated onGD 6-9, and was often associated with a short tail and anal atresia.

This will result following saturation of the iron carrying capacity of transferring, which generally takes place after 20 transfusions. Consequently, excess plasma iron (labile iron) is cleared rapidly by the liver, heart and endocrine tissues at a rate that exceeds 200 times normal uptake of transferring-bound iron. Excess labile iron within cells will destroy the structure and function of mitochondria, lysosomes, lipid membranes, proteins and DNA. The clinical consequences can include liver cirrhosis and fibroses, cardiomyopathy, diabetes and other endocrine disorders. With proper control of body iron at all times in patients, these effects are preventable but only some are reversible once tissue damage has occurred. The primary rate of iron chelating therapy is to bind and remove iron from the patient body at a rate either equal to or greater than the rate of iron uptake of transfused iron. Complete chelating should aim to achieve both iron balance and iron detoxification. In patients who accumulated dangerous tissue iron levels, removal of this iron is also highly desirable. Several iron cheaters have been developed to help achieve these objectives. The recent introduction of the effective oral cheater deferasirox provideschelation coverage and significant control of LPI levels over the entire 24 hour period. Evidently, administration of the drug at a dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day significantly controls iron levels in plasma, liver and myocrdiocytes in thalassemi a major patients. Accumulating clinical data from key studies indicate that thalassemia patients can lead a happy and enjoyable normal life similar to normal individuals if their treatment is performed right and they receive the proper clinical attention from the medical staff. Definitely, chelating therapy requires close monitoring of patients vital organ status and the treatment protocol should be adjusted accordingly. Long term treatment with iron chelation highlights the importance of titrating the dose of the drug for each patient according to individual rates of iron intake from continued blood transfusion, current iron storage levels, safety markers (renal function for example) and target body iron content desired.26 First International Faculty of Medicine Conference 2008The presentation will highlight some of the recent clinical data from leading clinicians In chelationtherapy from several parts of the world and the lessons that can be learned from their experience and work for the benefit to optimize the treatment of thalassemia major patients in our population.</p>",

We retrospectively evaluated the radiographs of 59 cases of open reduction, with and without Salter osteotomy, both to evaluate the long-term effects of the Salter osteotomy on the quality of the hips and to decide if it should be a routine adjunct to open reduction. We also compared the hips with the Salter osteotomy done at the time of primary open reduction with those in which it was done later as a secondary procedure to determine if the procedure actually affects the development and modeling of the acetabulum. This series is distinguished by the long follow-up to, or almost to, skeletal maturity.</p>\n<p>Methods: We reviewed the records and x-rays of sixty two (59) hips with DDH with no associated congenital or neuromuscular disorders who underwent open reduction as primary surgical treatment after the age of 1.5 years. All patients had their primary treatment in our hospital between 1975 and 1992 with a minimum follow-up of 9.6 years. There were 36 hips that had only open reduction as a primary procedure (Group R) and 26 hips that also had a Salter osteotomy (Group RS). In Group R there were 4 hips that had a subsequent secondary Salter osteotomy (Group R/S, the slash representing an interval of time). 15 First International Faculty ofMedicine Conference 2008 We evaluated radiographs done preoperatively, postoperatively and at the time of the most recent follow up visit. We measured the acetabular index (AI), center edge (CE) angles, and the sphericity of the femoral head by the Mose technique. The hips were assessed for avascular necrosis by the method of Kalamchi and MacEwen and the overall outcome graded according to Severin.</p>\n<p>Results: For Group R and Group RS, the mean ages at first operation were 4.9 years and 3.6 years respectively, and the mean radiological follow-ups were 11.3 years and 9.6 years. The pre-operative acetabular indices were 35.0º and 35.2º indicating that the severities of dysplasia were similar. 57.5% of Group R went on to have subsequent surgery compared to 23% of group RS. In groups R &amp; RS respectively, assessment of outcome at final follow-up revealed CE angles of 26.5º and 30.1º, mean Mose circle indices of 3.8º and 2.4º, avascular necrosis presence in 57.5% and 31%, and good (grades 1 &amp; 2) Severin results in 63% and 81%. In groups R/S &amp; RS the pre-operative acetabular indices were 31º and 37.6º indicating that the hips in group R/S were less dysplastic to start. Assessment of outcome at final follow-up revealed, in groups R/S and RS respectively, CE angles of 34.0º and 29.8º, mean Mose circle indices of 2.5º and 2.1º, avascular necrosis presence in 50% and 31%, and good (grades 1 &amp; 2) Severin results in 75% and 85%.</p>\n<p>Conclusions: Our results show that routinely performing a Salter osteotomy at the time of primary open reduction of the hip improves the long-term outcome of the hip. The femoral head is a better shape as evaluated by both the Mose and Severin methods and the acetabulum provides better coverage as indicated by the center-edge angle.

In my experience important obstacles in Palestine are; lack of cooperation &amp; coordination between health providers, lack of national treatment guidelines, insufficient preventive and control policies, shortage of human and financial resources, lack of well trained health provider team and important specialists, lack of patient and family education about management and coping, and finally inadequate financial coverage for the management cost. Proper management of diabetic children in Palestine as a developing country with special political situation, face many obstacles at different levels (national, MOH programs, family&amp; school)My experience and my recommendations in Palestine will concentrate on cooperation of physicians and nurses to help diabetic children and their families cope with their disease, improve their quality of life by proper management &amp; reducing morbidities. This can be achieved by follow-up of this group of patients in Proposed specialized well equipped clinic by a well trained team (physicians, nurses, psychologist, educator, and dietician), increase the awareness of their families and teachers about this disease and how to deal in emergencies (education programs), recruitment activities during holidays(camps, trips, sports), and home visits for special cases.</p>",

In a complex deformity involving many bones, articulations and soft tissue structures. The deformity may be idiopathic or associated with congenital or neuromuscular problems. Plain x-ray is the most dependable radiological exam for diagnosis and prognosis of clubfeet. The ossific nucleus of navicular usually appears between 3 – 5 years of age. However in clubfeet the appearance of navicular might be delayed or when appearing it might look “abnormal in shape”. Here was retrospectively evaluated x-rays of 41 feet which were clubfeet who were treated surgically in Hospital for the first time by soft tissue release, and evaluating the relationship of the appearance of navicular with the prognosis of the surgery.</p>\n<p>Methods: We reviewed the record and x-rays of 41 clubfeet with no associated congenital or<br />\nneuromuscular disorders who underwent soft tissue release as a primary surgical treatment. All the patients had their primary treatment in our Hospital between 1993 and 1998 with a follow-up of 5.9 years. There were 24 feet, which had normal shaped navicular and 17 feet with abnormal shaped navicular. We evaluated radiographs done pre-op, post-op and at the time of the most recent follow-up visit. We measured talocalcaneal angles, talohorizontal angles, space between articular surface of talus and cuniformis, length of navicular, level of dorsal subluxation of navicular.</p>\n<p>Results: For the feet with avascularized navicular and the non-avascularized mean age at surgery was 1.0 year &amp; 1.8 respectively. The mean radiological follow-up was 4.8, 6.9 respectively. Relapsed clubfoot was 15.7%, 16.6% respectively. Post-op infection 15.7, 8.3 respectively.

But increased incidence of avascular necrosis is related to the decreased distance between articular surface of talus and cuniformis and the age of the patient at time of surgery if the patient is less than 1 year old.</p>\n<p>Significance: Avascular necrosis has no prognostic value in clubfoot post surgery but it is preferable when doing the surgery to do it in a child 1 year or above and not compressing the navicular between the talus and cuniformis during surgery.</p>",

Severe influenza complications are most common in children younger than 2 years old. Children with chronic health problems like asthma and diabetes are at especially high risk of developing serious flu complications. Vaccination is the best method for preventing flu and its potentially severe complications in children.CDC recommends that all children aged 6 months up to their 19th birthday get a fluvaccine.CDC also recommends that people in contact with certain groups of children get a flu vaccine in order to protect the child (or children) in their lives from the flu. Examples of contacts are close contacts of children younger than 5 years old, out-of-home caregivers(nannies, daycare providers, etc.) of children younger than 5 years ,People who live with or have other close contact with a child or children of any age with a chronic health problem (asthma, diabetes, etc.),in addition, CDC recommends that all health care workers be vaccinated each year to keep from spreading the flu to their patients.

Children less than nine years of age being vaccinated for the first time should received two doses of influenza vaccine, spaced at least 4 weeks apart in the initial year. For inactivated (inject able) vaccine, the dose for children aged 6--35 months is 0.25 cc, and the dose for children aged 36 months--9 years is0.5cc.Updates on live vaccine use and antiviral drug use in children will be also reviewed</p>",

In the past two years we have performed fixation of long bones of lower limbs in 4 children with Osteogenesis Imperfect a using Fassier-Duval telescopic nail.</p>\n<p>Patients &amp; Methods: The average age of patients in the group treated by telescopic nails was 7.1 (5-8) years. All four children were diagnosed as Osteogenesis Imperfect a, two with Type I, one with Type III and one had an unrecognized type. All patients had an anamnesis of at least 8 previous pathologic fractures of limbs; in two of them pathologic vertebral fractures were also found. Two of the patients had previous surgery and underwent fixation by Nancy nails, the result of which was considered a failure. One patient had Coventry plating of hip fracture one year prior to telescopic nailing. The same patient had developed severe bilateral genu valgum which was treated by 8-plate patial epiphyseodesis one-half year before nailing. Six intramedullary telescopic femoral nailings and 4 intramedullary tibial nailings (10 procedures) were performed in four patients. In all patients multiple osteotomies of bone were performed in order to correct severe deformity. Soft bandage (Johns) was applied after surgery. Weight bearing was allowed after appearance of callus on control X-Ray (8-14 weeks after surgery, depending on age and weight of the child). All children received chronically treatment by infusions of Pamidronate.</p>\n<p>Results: Fracture healing at osteotomy site was achieved in all cases. All patients were free of pain. No cases of infection were observed, nor were cases of postoperative contracture of knee joint. No growth arrest was observed after surgery. Normal alignment was restored in all cases with previous malalignment of femur and tibia. Two of patients in this series were not walkers and did not begin to walk after the surgery. One patient with OI Type III perforation of distal locking of “male” nail through femoral condyle into knee joint was re-operated and the distal part of the nail was secured into the distal femoral epiphysis by bone cement.</p>\n<p>Conclusions: We consider fixation by Nancy Nails as inappropriate for treatment of Osteogenesis imperfect a. Fassier-Duval telescopic nail has proven useful for fixation of long bones in Osteogenesis Imperfect a and more secure than other devices used before for treatment of this pathology. The surgical technique is complicated but well developed.</p>",
