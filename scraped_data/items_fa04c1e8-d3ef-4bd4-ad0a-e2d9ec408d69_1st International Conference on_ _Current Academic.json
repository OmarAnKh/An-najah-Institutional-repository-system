Some linguists, in this regard, define language as nothing but a system of vocal symbols used to communicate ideas and thoughts among the members of a certain social society. This shows that language is mainly an oral activity and writing is considered a secondary system derived form the spoken language.  As a result, students who learn English either as a foreign or a second language should be encouraged to speak the language to a certain extent that enables them to communicate with other speakers of the language. To produce students who are proficient in a foreign language, educators should ensure that their students are participating in a variety of performance-based tasks based upon authentic use of language for communication (Fuller, 2011). Foreign language teachers, then, should design assessment practices using a variety of communicative contexts, thus providing a way to document students’ progress in language ability as they continue in a foreign language program of study. Moreover, students who study English either as a foreign language or a second language are assumed to be provided with more and more opportunities to practice oral communication skills inside and outside the classroom in natural and meaningful situations. This can be done by using different types of activities and practices that motivate the students to use the language naturally and purposefully in meaningful situations. Contextualization of language, in this regard, has been shown to increase students’ motivation, engagement in learning, the amount of information learned, and their self-perception of competence in the target language (Cordova &amp; Lepper, 1996). Based on this assumption, students' perspectives should be investigated and taken into account when they are involved in the teaching –learning process especially at higher education levels as they represent the first beneficiaries of the teaching-learning process. Moreover, university students are to be given more chances to actively participate in selecting some teaching materials which are hoped to suit their needs and interests especially when talking about learning languages and English in particular.

Technological advances and widespread access to information and communication technologies have facilitated the rapid growth of blended learning approaches in both higher education and corporate training contexts. The American Society for Training and Development identified blended learning as one of the top 10 emergent trends in the knowledge delivery industry (Finn, 2002). Since then, the visibility of blended learning environments has increased dramatically in both formal education and corporate training settings. There is increasing interest in the concept of blended learning as evidenced by greater numbers of books, journal articles, and trade magazine articles that directly address issues related to blended learning. This research will investigate the effect of implementing blended learning and its appropriateness in developing students' language skills at An-Najah National University.</p>",

The study addressed the following questions:<br />\n1-What are the Western cultural aspects that are implied in the NorthStar , Intermediate Textbooks?<br />\n2-To what extent is the foreign culture included in the NorthStar Intermediate level?<br />\n3- To what extent are the Arab-Islamic cultural aspects included in the NorthStar Intermediate level ?</p>\n<p>The study revealed that the textbook involved different types of cultural aspects and that the frequency of some cultural aspects was higher in some units depending on the main theme of the unit. These frequencies ranged between 22 and 274 and the religious aspect had the lowest frequency, while the social aspect had the highest frequency. Moreover, it was found that the textbook did not only focus on different aspects of a foreign culture but it also dealt with different cultures. The content analysis  revealed that the most frequent cultural aspects  were related the American culture which indicated an obvious bias towards the foreign cultural aspects in general and the American cultural aspects in particular at the expense of the Arabic –Islamic culture as no unit that talks about Arabs or Muslims or any Arab or Islamic country  except the mentioning of the word “Arab” which was mentioned only once in the textbook and in a way that even displeases the Arabs.</p>\n<p>In the light of the results, the researchers recommended analyzing and evaluating the content of EFL textbooks of foreign authors to be sure that they do not include cultural aspects that might go against our Arab-Islamic culture. Therefore, careful attention should be paid  to how the others are presented and how to filter the undesirable cultural aspects that in a textbook. Finally, the researchers called  for EFL national curricula at the Palestinian universities.</p>",

Images of the moon in Coleridge’s poetry, particularly in “Dejection” and the Trio, are used to reflect the poet’s two ambivalent spiritual states, that is, dejection and gladness, which are manifestations of the poet’s sterility and creativity, respectively. Images of the moon and the sky are taken from observable nature, but Coleridge connects them with the poet’s inner self. These images are also used to form beautiful, romantic natural scenery. In addition, Coleridge links the image of the hidden and half-hidden moon with either of his two spiritual states, depending on the context. In contrast, he connects the image of the sky with happiness and fruitful contact with nature, which fulfills his poetic vision and inspiration.</p>",
