                "value": "The main idea of this study is examining the value of commercial banks operate in Palestine; excluding Islamic banks. The study presents guidelines to value banks and provides a framework for banks’ valuation based on two generally acceptable valuation models: model of discounted residual income (RI) and the model of discounted equity cash flows (ECF) applied for banks in Palestine. Both models are used to calculate the equity value of banks in Palestine and provide an equivalent results and they are highly recommended. Commercial Banking sector that are operating in Palestine has been chosen for conducting this research, excluding Islamic banks  due to the analogy purposes of the sample, in which thirteen (13) commercial banks remain as research sample as in 2016. All the necessary data are collected from each bank’s annual audited financial statements and Palestinian Monetary Authority PMA annual Reports. This data is collected from 2008 to 2016 and future data is forecasted for the next five years.\r\n High correlation between both models is a consequence of the T-Test analysis for the difference between values of banks using the recommended models. This result is similar to previous studies such as (Halsey, 2001) which discussed that the discounted residual income model is equivalent to the discounted equity cash flow model. The significant 2 tailed is less than 0.05, this insures that there is no difference between values of banks using the two models. All factors in both models affect the bank’s value except the depreciation in ECF model. The main two factors that affect value in ECF model are net income and net increase in loans. For the RI model, NI and RI are the main two factors that affect value. Due to estimation issues, the equity banks values for both models were equivalent not the exact.",

Therein lies the wisdom of the inspection period option so that the buyer can be cautious, carefully considers and takes a good look at the item and gets advice from specialists. The inspection period option is three days or less, and it moves to the heirs.

As a result, the 12th grade students in Palestine undergo academic psychological stress; this stage is accompanied by stress and anxiety on the student which affects the exam performance. Perfectionism is positively correlated to the students' exam performance and an indicator of academic achievement such as grade point average. Perceived self-efficacy is considered as a standard to predict grades, achievement.\r\nObjective: The current study's aim was measure the effect of psychological stress generated by general high school exam on academic performance among high school students.\r\nMethods: Eighty-two high school students (12th grade) in Bethlehem Governorate that were intended to apply for the General secondary examination (GSE) in 2020/2021 academic year. The Arabic version of academic Perceived self-efficacy (Hakim, 2015) was used, and the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Hewitt & Flett, 1990) was validated by using translation-back translation method to the Arabic language. General secondary examination consists of 10 Arabic and 10 Math questions. A simple random sampling method used to select (82) students. The students were divided for two experimental groups. The study relied on the quasi-experimental design as a method of study. Data was analyzed by used ANCOVA (analysis of covariance).\r\n Main results: ANCOVA was conducted to examine the effect of (manipulation) on two experimental groups regarding time testing (pre- post Arabic exam) and (pre-post Math exam), findings revealed showed a clear difference between pre and post manipulation on both Arabic and Math exams. The finding revealed no significant main effects of Perceived self –efficacy and perfectionism as moderators variables, while the Perceived self-efficacy was significant with Arabic exam and not with other variables. There were significant differences in the mean score for the pre-math exam in favor of males. \r\n Conclusion and recommendation: In other words, psychological stress plays a significant role in reducing the performance of students in the experimental group “2” (direct manipulation) in both the Arabic and Math exams. It is the researcher’s recommendation; Counselors could play an important role in assisting students who are suffering from psychological stress by preparing students for the future.

Secondary data, annual reports, and disclosures were used to analyze and draw conclusions and recommendations. A multiple linear regression model was used to deduce the effect of CRs on the performance of banks. Tobin's Q, Return on Assets (ROA), and Return on Equity (ROE) were used to measure the performance of banks. The ratio of Non-Performing Loans to total loans (NPLs) and loans to total assets (LTA) were used to measure CRs. CG was measured using an index based on the extent of literature and prevailing circumstances in the Palestinian and Jordanian environments. \r\nThe regression results showed mixed results regarding the impact of CRs on the FP of banks. LTA has a significant and positive effect on TOBINS Q and ROE, but an insignificant and positive effect on ROA. On the other hand, NPLs has a significant and negative effect on ROA, whereas NPLs has a significant and positive effect on TOBINS Q. \r\nThe findings stated that NPLs has an insignificant and positive effect on ROE. Moreover, the results demonstrated that CG moderated the relationship between CRs and FP of banks. \r\nThis means that the high competence of CG rules decreases the negative effect of CRs on FP. In light of these results, the study suggests the following set of recommendations: importance of paying attention to bank loans; implementing more effective credit processes and banking policies; assuring that the credit of the potential borrower is appropriately assessed; Deconcentration of credit in particular sector; constant reviewing of CG codes and learning from the experiences of developed countries in corporate and bank governance; directing companies to pay attention to CG practices through laws and legislation that require companies to follow CG practices; and conducting workshops on CG and its significance in the presence of company management and decision-makers.\r\nKeywords: Credit Risk, Financial Performance, Corporate Governance, Palestine Securities' Exchange, Amman Securities' Exchange",

Furthermore, the impact of ownership structure and board characteristics on the level of CSRD is examined.  Data was collected from a sample of 44 companies' annual reports -which constitute 91.6% of Palestinian listed companies- for the period 2013-2017. In order to measure CSRD, a disclosure index including 30 items of social responsibility information was constructed and applied. To achieve the objectives of the study, Generalized Least Square (GLS) regression was used. The results of the study reveals that, on average, a company discloses 43.7% of the items included in the disclosure index. In addition, a significant positive relationship between gender diversity, audit committee, firm size, auditor type and CSRD exists. In contrast, there is a significant negative relationship between board size, CEO duality and CSRD. Furthermore, board independence, board ownership, ownership concentration, financial leverage and financial performance were found to have no effect on CSRD. The study recommends that policy makers and regulators can improve the extent of CSR disclosure through extending the minimum regulatory requirements concerning CSR reporting in Palestine. Furthermore, policy makers and regulators are encouraged to establish an official Palestinian CSR index that can be used to evaluate and compare CSR practice and disclosure among Palestinian companies.",

This variable is operationalized by several measures including gender existence, board size, CEO duality, independence director, and institutional investors. The study uses dividend per share (DPS) as dependent variable. A robust least square regression model used to evaluate the empirical model in the current study using panel data analysis. Data was gathered from the (PEX) website as well as the annual reports of the companies sampled. The research find that at the 5% level of confidence, there is a positive significant relationship between Board size, gender participation, and dividend per share (DPS). Furthermore, at the 5% level, there is a significant positive relationship between firm size, profitability, audit firm, and DPS. Firm leverage, on the other hand, has a negative impact on the DPS at the 1% level of confidence. The research's main contribution in focuses data analysis on the final result of firms operations which is the core concern of investment decisions, it may also assist legislative and official institutions in this field in making their best efforts to establish governance codes in the manner that society wishes",

                "value": "هدفت هذه الدراسة إلى معرفة مدى توافق التعليم المحاسبي في الجامعات الفلسطينية مع متطلبات معايير التعليم المحاسبي الدولية (IAES)، الصادرة عن الاتحاد الدولي للمحاسبين (IFAC)، وأثره على جودة التعليم المحاسبي، إذ استهدف الباحث قياس مدى تبني الجامعات الفلسطينية لمتطلبات المعيار الأول (IAES1) الخاصة ((بمتطلبات الالتحاق ببرامج التعليم المحاسبي المهني)) وهي: قبول المؤهلين للنجاح، المرونة وعدم التشدد في القبول بما يضمن عدم حرمان المؤهلين للنجاح، متابعة التغيرات وتحديد العوامل المؤثرة على أداء الطلبة، تفسير وتوضيح الأسس التي اعتمدت للقبول واطلاع الأطراف المعنية عليها، اتاحة الفرصة للالتحاق من خلال مواقع الكترونية أو منشورات مناسبة توضح متطلبات الالتحاق والأمور المالية والإدارية ومسارات البرنامج والتعليمات الأخرى ذات العلاقة (دليل الطالب)، والتوعية عن البرامج من كل الجوانب الأكاديمية والمهنية والعملية وأدوات التقييم وفرص العمل بعد التخرج.\r\nوكذلك  هدفت الى قياس مدى تبني الجامعات الفلسطينية لمتطلبات المعيار الثاني (IAES2) الخاصة ((بمتطلبات الكفاءة الفنية ((التطور المهني الأولي))، كمخرجات للتعلم المحاسبي وهي: اكتساب الطلبة لمهارات المحاسبة المالية، مهارات المحاسبة الإدارية، مهارات التمويل والإدارة المالية، المهارات الضريبية، مهارات المراجعة وخدمات التأكيد، مهارات الحوكمة وإدارة المخاطر والرقابة الداخلية، والقانون التجاري واللوائح المنظمة له، وتكنولوجيا المعلومات، والأعمال البيئية التنظيمية، والاقتصاد الجزئي والكلي وهياكل الأسواق، ومهارات إدارية لاستراتيجيات الأعمال. \r\nكذلك مدى تبنى الجامعات الفلسطينية لمتطلبات المعيار الثالث (IAES3) الخاصة ((بمتطلبات الكفاءة المهنية كمخرجات للتعلم المحاسبي))، وهي: اكتساب الطلبة للمهارات الذهنية كالتفكير الإبداعي والتفكير الناقد وحل المشكلات، المهارات الاجتماعية كمهارات الاتصال والتواصل والعمل الجماعي والعمل بروح الفريق، المهارات الشخصية كالالتزام بالتعلم المستمر وإدارة الذات ومواجهة التحديات، والمهارات التنظيمية كالالتزام بالمواعيد واحترام التسلسل الإداري وتفويض الصلاحيات.\r\nهذا بالإضافة الى قياس مدى تبني الجامعات الفلسطينية لمتطلبات المعيار الرابع (IAES4) الخاصة ((بمتطلبات القيم وأخلاقيات المهنة كمخرجات للتعلم المحاسبي))، وهي: الشك المهني والاستجواب العقلي الناقد وتقييم البدائل، احترام معايير المهنة وتطبيق المبادئ الأخلاقية كالنزاهة والشفافية، الالتزام بمصلحة الجمهور والمسؤولية الاجتماعية، وإدراك العلاقة بين الأخلاق والقانون، وتحليل نتائج السلوك غير الأخلاقي، وإدراك اثر الأخلاق في بيئة المنظمة.\r\nوقد تم دراسة مدى التزام الجامعات الفلسطينية بمتطلبات الأربعة معايير الأولى قصدا، وذلك لارتباطها ببرامج درجة البكالوريوس في المحاسبة، والذي هو موضوع الدراسة.\r\nواستهدف الباحث كذلك تحديد مدخل واستراتيجيات التعليم المحاسبي المناسبة في الجامعات الفلسطينية وفقا لمتطلبات المعايير الدولية للتعليم المحاسبي وانعكاس ذلك على مدى توفر جودة التعليم المحاسبي في الجامعات الفلسطينية. \r\nولغايات تحقيق أهداف الدراسة فقد استخدم الباحث المنهج الوصفي التحليلي والذي من خلاله حاول تقييم مدى توافق التعليم المحاسبي في الجامعات الفلسطينية مع متطلبات معايير التعليم المحاسبي الدولية الصادرة عن الاتحاد الدولي للمحاسبين وأثره على جودة التعليم المحاسبي، وذلك بهدف الوصول إلى تعميمات ذات معنى لإثراء المعرفة عن الموضوع، وقد تم جمع البيانات من المصادر الأولية والثانوية، إذ انه تم توزيع 200 قائمة استبانة لدراسة مفرداتها وحصر وتجميع المعلومات اللازمة للبحث، ومن ثم تفريغها وتحليلها الإحصائي وتوظيف الاختبارات الإحصائية المناسبة، وهي الاحصاءات الوصفية، واختبار  Tللعينة الواحدة، ومعامل ارتباط بيرسون، بهدف الوصول إلى دلالات ذات قيمة ومؤشرات لدعم موضوع الدراسة واستخدم الباحث مصادر البيانات الثانوية لمعالجة الإطار النظري للدراسة من خلال الدوريات والمقالات والدراسات المنشورة وأطروحات الماجستير والدكتوراه ذات الصلة، واستعان الباحث بشبكة الانترنت والنسخ الالكترونية الموجودة على صفحاتها.\r\nوتمثل مجتمع الدراسة في المحاضرين والأساتذة وطلبة السنة الرابعة في الجامعات الفلسطينية والمزاولين لمهنة المحاسبة في الضفة الغربية، وقد وظف الباحث أسلوب الوصف التحليلي، إذ تم توزيع 200 قائمة استبانة واستردت كاملة، بمعنى أن نسبة الاستجابة بلغت 100%، وبعد تفحص القوائم المستردة لم يستبعد أي منها نظراً لتحقق الشوط المطلوبة، وعليه فقد تم تحليل 200 قائمة استبانة، بالإضافة الى مقارنة خطط الجامعات وبرامجها مع متطلبات المعايير الدولية.\r\nوتوصلت الدراسة إلى مجموعة من النتائج ومن أهمها: ان الجامعات الفلسطينية تتوافق مع متطلبات الالتحاق ببرامج التعليم المحاسبي الدولي بمستوى 56.3%، ومتطلبات الكفاءة الفنية بنسبة 57.566%، ومتطلبات الكفاءة المهنية بنسبة 60%، وأخلاقيات المهنة بنسبة 60.5%.\r\nوهناك ارتباط بواقع 76.175% بين متطلبات الاربعة معايير الدولية الاولى وجودة التعليم المحاسبي في الجامعات الفلسطينية، مما ينعكس على جودة التعليم المحاسبي في فلسطين، اذ ان النسب المحددة اعلاه لمدى التزام الجامعات الفلسطينية بالمعايير الدولية للتعليم المحاسبي تشكل درجة ومستوى جودة التعليم المحاسبي في الجامعات الفلسطينية من وجهة نظر الخريجين والهيئات التدريسية، وما لديهم من كفايات وقدرات نسبة الى متطلبات المعايير الدولية للتعليم المحاسبي.\r\nومن خلال المقارنة بين خطط وبرامج الجامعات الفلسطينية اتضح ان برامج الجامعات الفلسطينية لا تشتمل على مساقات مستقلة ركزت عليها المعايير الدولية وهي مساق الحوكمة، ومساق الاعمال والبيئة التنظيمية، ومساق خاص بالمهارات المهنية ، واخر خاص باخلاقيات المهنة والسلوك المهني، علما ان الساعات المعتمدة لمتطلبات الجامعات الفلسطينية شكلت ما نسبته 20% من اجمالي الساعات المعتمدة لبرامج بكالوريوس المحاسبة.\r\nكما ان المعايير الدولية تتطلب تبني استراتيجية التعليم المحاسبي بالمخرجات وليس بالاهداف، في حين ان الجامعات الفلسطينية تعمل بموجب استراتيجية التعليم بالأهداف، \r\nوأوصت الدراسة بمجموعة من التوصيات ومن اهمها: زيادة مدى التزام الجامعات الفلسطينية بمتطلبات المعايير الدولية للتعليم المحاسبي لغايات تحسين وتطوير جودة التعليم المحاسبي، وذلك من خلال متابعة اصدارات الاتحاد الدولي للمحاسبين وتبني مساقات خاصة بالمهارات الفنية كمساقي الحوكمة والاعمال وبيئتها التنظيمية، ومساق خاص بالمهارات المهنية، ومساق خاص باخلاقيات المهنة والسلوك المهني، والعمل على زيادة ساعات التدريب العملي للطلبة، وتبني المدخل الحديث في التعليم المحاسبي والقائم على التعلم بالمخرجات.\r\nكما اوصت الدراسة  الباحثين بالعمل اكمال دراسة بقية المعايير وتحليل المحتوى  للخطط والمقررات الدراسية الجامعية المعتمدة ، لمعرفة مدى ملائمتها لمعايير الدولية للتعليم المحاسبي",

                "value": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the extent and nature of voluntary disclosure (VD) of the Palestinian companies listed on the Palestine Exchange (PEX).  Furthermore, the impact of board composition, board committees and firm characteristics on the level of VD is examined.  Data was collected from a sample of 45 companies' annual reports -which constitute 93.7% of Palestinian listed companies- for the period 2013-2017. In order to measure VD, a disclosure index including 55 items of voluntary information was constructed and applied. To achieve the objectives of the study, multiple regression was used. The results of the study reveal that, on average, a company discloses 56.31% of the items included in the disclosure index. In addition, a significant positive relationship between board gender diversity, audit committee, governance committee, nomination and compensation committee and firm size and VD exists. In contrast, there is a significant negative relationship between board size, CEO duality and VD. Furthermore, board independence, director ownership, ownership concentration, financial leverage, firm profitability, audit firm and firm age were found to have no effect on VD. The study recommends that policy makers and regulators are encouraged to establish an official Palestinian VDI that can be used to evaluate and compare voluntary practice and disclosure among Palestinian companies. Furthermore, the policy makers and managers have to motivate the presence of board committees in companies and activate their rules.",

                "value": "بعد الأزمة المالية العالمية الأخيرة، تم توجيه العديد من الانتقادات لمعيار المحاسبة الخاصة بالأدوات المالية، على سبيل المثال، تم انتقاد معيار المحاسبة الدولي رقم (39) بكونه سبباً رئيسياً في الأزمة نظراً لكونه يسمح بتصنيف الأدوات المالية بطريقة تفصح المجال لإدارة المؤسسات بإخفاء الوضع المالي الحقيقي للمؤسسة. كما أنه يعمل على تكوين مخصصات قليلة ومتأخرة لمواجهة الهبوط في قيمة الأدوات المالية. وبناءً على ذلك، قام مجلس معايير المحاسبة الدولية بإصدار المعيار الدولي لإعداد التقارير المالية رقم (9) للتغلب على العيوب السابقة.\r\n     قدم المعيار الدولي لإعداد التقارير المالية رقم (9) طريقة جديدة لتصنيف وقياس الأدوات المالية، حيث اصبح نموذج اعمال المؤسسة وخصاص التدفقات النقدية اساساً لتصنيف الأدوات المالية بدلاً من نية وقدرة إدارة المؤسسة التي اعتمدت سابقاً كأساس للتصنيف.  إن اعتماد الطريقة الجديدة للتصنيف والقياس سيؤثر على قائمة الدخل الشامل وقائمة حقوق الملكية للمؤسسات نظراً لاختلاف آلية معالجة الأرباح أو الخسائر والقيمة العادلة الخاصة بالأدوات المالية.\r\n     كما وقدم المعيار الدولي لإعداد التقارير المالية رقم (9) طريقة جديدة لاحتساب مخصص التدني في قيمة الأدوات المالية بحيث يأخذ بالاعتبار التغير في القيمة العادلة للأدوات المالية قبل وجود دليل فعلي على ذلك. إن اعتماد الطريقة الجديدة لاحتساب مخصص التدني في قيمة الأدوات المالية يتوقع له أن يؤثر بشكل جوهري على محاسبة الأدوات المالية، بالإضافة إلى ارتفاع مخصص التدني بشكل كبير خصوصاً عن تطبيق الطريقة الجديدة المبنية على عمر الأداة المالية، فضلاً عن أخذ المعلومات ذات النظرة المستقبلية في عملية التقييم والقياس (BCBS, 2017).\r\n     إن الهدف الرئيسي من هذه الأطروحة العمل على اختبار أثر تطبيق المعيار الدولي لإعداد التقارير المالية رقم (9) على القوائم المالية ذات الصلة للبنوك العاملة في فلسطين والأردن. ولتحقيق هذا الهدف، عمل الباحث على تقسيم الأطروحة إلى الأهداف الفرعية التالية:\r\n     أولاً: دراسة أثر تطبيق المرحلة الأولى من المعيار \"التصنيف والقياس\" على قائمة الدخل الشامل وقائمة حقوق الملكية للبنوك العاملة في فلسطين والأردن. قام الباحث بتجميع البيانات المالية للقائمتين من التقارير السنوية للبنوك العاملة في فلسطين (16 بنك) والأردن (15 بنك) خلال العام الذي تم تطبيق تلك المرحلة به (2011-2012). تم تحليل البيانات باستخدام اختبار Paired Sample Test لقياس أثر تطبيق تلك المرحلة، حيث اظهرت النتائج عدم وجود تأثير جوهري لتطبيق المرحلة الأولى من المعيار على قائمتي الدخل الشامل وحقوق الملكية.\r\n     ثانياً: دراسة أثر تطبيق المرحلة الثانية من المعيار \"احتساب مخصص التدني لقيمة الأدوات المالية\" على ما يلي: قائمة الدخل الشامل، المخصصات الخاصة، المخصصات العامة وكفاية رأس المال للبنوك العاملة في فلسطين والأردن. قام الباحث بتجميع البيانات المالية من البنوك العاملة في فلسطين (14 بنك) والأردن (24 بنك) من خلال استبان معد لذلك الغرض. تم تحليل البيانات باستخدام اختبار  One-Sample Binominal Testلقياس الأثر المتوقع لتطبيق تلك المرحلة، حيث اظهرت النتائج أن تطبيق المرحلة الثانية من المعيار يتوقع أن يؤثر بشكل جوهري على قائمة الدخل الشامل، المخصصات الخاصة، المخصصات العامة وكفاية رأس المال للبنوك العاملة في فلسطين والأردن. تجدر الإشارة إلى أن الأثر المتوقع يختلف من بنك لأخر بناءً على ملف المخاطر للبنك، مستويات كفاية رأسمال البنوك ومحفظة الأدوات المالية الخاصة بكل بنك.\r\n     ثالثاً: دراسة الصعوبات المتعلقة بتطبيق المعيار الدولي لإعداد التقارير المالية رقم (9) والتي تواجه البنوك العاملة في فلسطين والأردن. قام الباحث بتجميع البيانات المالية من البنوك العاملة في فلسطين (14 بنك) والأردن (24 بنك) من خلال استبان معد لذلك الغرض. تم تحليل البيانات باستخدام اختبار  One-Sample Test لقياس تلك الصعوبات، حيث أظهرت النتائج وجود العديد من الصعوبات في عدة حقول منها: تطبيق نموذج الاعمال، تحديد خصائص التدفقات النقدية للأدوات المالية، تحضير البيانات لغايات المعيار، تحديد زيادة مخاطر الائتمان، التقييم المجمع، تغير وتطبيق الانظمة الخاصة بتطبيق المعيار، الإفصاح والتكلفة المتعلقة بالتطبيق.\r\n     تشير نتائج الدراسة إلى وجود أدلة مبكرة على الاثر المتوقع لتطبيق المعيار الدولي لإعداد التقارير المالية رقم (9) بناءً على عينة صغيرة من البنوك العاملة في الأسواق المالية الناشئة. وبناءً عليه، قد يتطلب الأمر من المشرعين مزيداً من التحليل للأثر المترتب على التطبيق واتخاذ الإجراءات التصحيحية الواجبة، النظر في امكانية تطبيق فترة انتقالية لعكس اثر تطبيق المعيار بناءً على ارشادات BCBS (2017)، وإصدار التعليمات الإضافية لمساعدة البنوك على التغلب على معيقات وصعوبات تطبيق المعيار.",

To achieve this goal and to answer the research questions, the researcher used regression model which mainly includes fair value levels as independent variables, and stocks price, for those companies have portfolios, as a dependent variable. The targeted population is the Palestinian financial organizations (13 institutions) that include portfolios under Palestine Exchange (PEX) from period 2011 to 2016 which is the most recent period. The research results showed that the fair value hierarchy significantly affects the relevance and reliability of information presented to the investor's, the fair value level 3 assets are significantly priced higher than level 1 and 2 fair value assets. Finally, level 3 gains do not reduce investors' pricing of Level 3 asset, due to the investors’ trust in entities’ information, since it is audited and disclosed in the financial reports in accordance with the requirements of standards. This research recommended to improve Palestinian Capital Market, to restore investor's trust, maintain management transparency and governance, increase investor's awareness of the fair value and conduct additional research to be carried out to gain a continuous view, knowledge, and insight of value relevance of IFRS 13 fair value hierarchy information in Palestinian institutions.",

                "value": "Municipalities are the public institutions that are responsible for providing services to citizens. Capital development projects are on the top priorities of municipalities. Such a priority is very demanding and critical due to the investment required, this is in addition to the scarcity of revenue sources in conjunction with the increased population. In Palestine, the trend of revenue per capita is decreasing in 73% of the sample municipalities. Thus, employing new ways of financing can be the solution. The percentage of employing debts at the Palestinian local authorities is very few. Accordingly, there is a room for using debts in certain circumstances as a new financial instrument with a debt limit according to the legislations and regulations. Municipal bonds have been used worldwide to finance capital investments at the local government units. This research concentrates on the determinants of municipal bond issuance, types of bonds, bond sale methods, debt maturity, par value, and risk-return relationship.\r\nThe purpose of this research is to develop and to find methods for assessing creditworthiness that are suitable and applicable to local government units in Palestine. The sample was composed of 11 municipalities in the West Bank.\r\n  Various variables such as macroeconomic and municipal status variables are identified to measure the effect of issuing municipal bonds on financing capital investment projects for the local government units in Palestine.\r\nThe study of the Palestinian economy has taken into consideration the following factors: historical interest rates, international financial position, external debt and general budget structure. Moreover, macroeconomic variables have been measured by revenues and expenditures per capita, cost of labour and unemployment rate. Municipal status variables have the following subgroup variables: municipality size, financial reporting quality, outstanding debt, and financial distress. Various financial ratios are used. Furthermore, comparative and cross-sectional analysis has been conducted besides horizontal and vertical analysis; the analysis for these ratios has been carried out to determine the municipal status variables.\r\nThe research concludes that macroeconomic variables and municipality status affect the issuance of \"municipal revenue bonds.\" Based on testing the methodology, three municipalities are recommended to issue revenue municipal bonds.",

                "value": "هدفت هذه الدراسة إلى التعرف على أثر جودة الأرباح على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي للشركات الصناعية المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين وبورصة عمان للأوراق المالية بالإعتماد على عناصر جودة الأرباح، باعتبارها المتغير المستقل (مستوى السيولة، نسب التدفق النقدي التشغيلي، ديمومة الأرباح واستمراريتها في المستقبل، خلو الأرباح من ممارسة إدارة الأرباح، توفر النقدية)، عند مستوى دلالة (α≤0.05). وتم الإعتماد في هذه الدراسة على نسب السيولة لقياس مستوى السيولة. وهذه النسب هي: التغير في رأس المال العامل، ومعيار الإقتراب من النقد . وكذلك نسب التدفق النقدي التشغيلي، وهذه النسب هي: نسبة التدفقات النقدية من الأنشطة التشغيلية للسهم العادي، ومؤشر النقدية التشغيلي، ونسبة التدفق النقدي من المبيعات إلى المبيعات، ونسبة جودة المستحقات، ونسبة قياس المستحقات، ومؤشر دليل النشاط التشغيلي، ونسبة العائد على حقوق الملكية من التدفقات النقدية التشغيلية، ونسبة صافي التدفق النقدي التشغيلي إلى مجموع الأصول. واستخدمت الباحثة نموذج Richardson 2005 لقياس ديمومة الأرباح وتكررها في المستقبل، ونموذج جونز المعدل لقياس خلو الأرباح من ممارسة إدارة الأرباح، و لقياس توفر النقدية من عدمه بالإعتماد على وجودها. وتم تطبيق الدراسة على جميع الشركات الصناعية المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين وعددها 13 شركة ، وعينة من الشركات الصناعية المدرجة في بورصة عمان للأوراق المالية وعددها 23 شركة من أصل 48 خلال الفترة 2010-2017 م.\r\nوقد خلصت نتائج الدراسة إلى أن جودة الأرباح تعتبر ذات مضمون معلوماتي يعزز من قدرات أصحاب العلاقة من مستثمرين ومستخدمي التقارير المالية في اتخاذ القرارات المالية الرشيدة وتوجيه استثماراتهم نحو البيئة الإقتصادية الملائمة بما يضمن أعلى عائد يمكن الحصول عليه من هذا الإستثمار. وأن هناك أثر لجودة الأرباح على متوسط أسعار الأسهم لجميع الشركات الصناعية المساهمة العامة المدرجة أسهمها في بورصة فلسطين وبورصة عمان للأوراق المالية، وتشكل الأثر الأكبر للمتغير المستقل على المتغير التابع في سوق عمان للأوراق المالية أكثر منه في السوق الفلسطيني، فقد بلغ تأثير جودة الأرباح (المتغير المستقل) على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي (المتغير التابع ) في سوق فلسطين للأوراق المالية 71%، بينما في سوق عمان للأوراق المالية فقد بلغ هذا التأثير 80%. ويعتبر هذا التغير ذو أهمية لما يتبعه من تأثير على قرار المستثمرين في هذه الشركات بسبب اعتمادهم الأساسي على رقم صافي الربح المعلن عنه في القوائم المالية.\r\nوتأثرت أسعار أسهم الشركات الصناعية المساهمة المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين وبورصة عمان للأوراق المالية بمستوى السيولة. وكان التأثير الأكبر لمستوى السيولة للشركات الصناعية المدرجة في سوق عمان للأوراق المالية حيث بلغ هذا التأثير 66.2%. وهي نسبة أعلى منه في بورصة فلسطين للأوراق المالية التي بلغت فقط 8.7%. وكذلك هناك أثر لنسب التدفق النقدي التشغيلي على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي للشركات الصناعية المدرجة أسهمها في بورصة فلسطين وبورصة عمان للأوراق المالية. وقد كان هذا الأثر في بورصة عمان 78.6%، وهي نسبة أعلى منه للشركات الصناعية في السوق الفلسطيني حيث بلغت هذه النسبة 52.9%. ومن هذه النتائج يظهر أهمية التركيز على مبلغ صافي التدفق النقدي التشغيلي في قائمة التدفقات النقدية وليس فقط على مبلغ صافي الربح المدرج في قائمة الدخل.\r\nوكذلك إن الشركات الصناعية في السوق الفلسطيني والأردني تقوم بممارسة إدارة الأرباح بشكل متفاوت حيث بلغ عدد الشركات الفلسطينية الممارسة لإدارة الأرباح 10 شركات من أصل 13 شركة أي ما نسبته 76.92%. أما في السوق الأردني فقد بلغ عدد هذه الشركات 14 شركة من أصل 23 شركة أي ما نسبته 60.86%. وكانت ممارسة إدارة الأرباح في الشركات الصناعية المساهمة المدرجة في السوق الفلسطيني بنسبة أكبر منه للشركات الصناعية في السوق الأردني.\r\n وكذلك هناك أثر لاستمرارية الأرباح وتكررها في المستقبل على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي للشركات الصناعية الأردنية والفلسطينية المدرجة في البورصة، حيث بلغ تأثير هذا المتغير على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي للشركات الصناعية الفلسطينية 25.92% وهي نسبة أعلى منه للشركات المدرجة في بورصة عمان والتي بلغت 10.27%. ويعني ذلك أن الشركات الصناعية في السوق الفلسطيني تتأثر بوجود استمرارية الأرباح الحالية والمستقبلية أكثر منه في الشركات الأردنية.\r\nوتوصلت النتائج أخيراً بوجود أثر لتوفر النقدية على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي للشركات الصناعية المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين وبورصة عمان للأوراق المالية. وأظهرت النتائج بأن تأثير توفر النقدية على متوسط سعر السهم السوقي في السوق الأردني بلغ 70.02%، وهي نسبة أعلى منه في السوق الفلسطيني التي بلغت فيه 19.3% فقط . ويعني ذلك أن توفر النقدية في القوائم المالية للشركات الصناعية الأردنية يرفع من جودة أرباح هذه الشركات.\r\nوبينت التوصيات في نهاية الدراسة، ضرورة نشر الوعي بين مستخدمي القوائم المالية للشركات الصناعية الفلسطينية والأردنية بعدم الإعتماد على مبلغ صافي الربح في القوائم المالية بحد ذاته. بل التركيز على معرفة مصادر ومكونات صافي الدخل. والنظر إلى أبعاد هذا الرقم بما يحويه من تدفقات فعليه ومستحقات. وكذلك ضرورة قيام هذه الشركات بالإعتماد على النسب المالية المستندة إلى أساس الإستحقاق وإلى الأساس النقدي جنباً إلى جنب من أجل تقييم جودة الأرباح في الشركات، وذلك لبيان أهمية التدفق النقدي الشتغيلي وليس فقط مبلغ صافي الربح. وتوصية الشركات باستقطاب العمليات المالية المرتبطة بالتدفقات النقدية التشغيلية، وتقليل الإعتماد على العمليات المالية المعتمدة على الإستحقاق. وذلك لأنه بزيادة التدفق النقدي التشغيلي يرتفع مستوى جودة أرباح هذه الشركات. مما ينعكس ذلك في أسعار أسهمها في البورصة نتيجة تحسين سمعتها في الأسواق التنافسية مما يعظم قيمتها. مع ضرورة قيام الجهات المختصة بإلزام الشركات في البورصة بالإفصاح عن جودة أرباحها المالية في تقاريرها السنوية حتى تمكن المستثمر من توقع الأرباح المستقبلية بصورة أكثر دقة وشفافية. مما يعني الإلتزام بدرجة أكبر بمتطلبات الإفصاح في التقارير المالية السنوية، من خلال ممارسة الرقابة الدائمة على عمل الشركات، والتأكد من التزامها بالقوانين المعمول بها، مع إبراز دور مكاتب ولجان التدقيق في رفع مستوى جودة أرباح الشركات من خلال التركيز على بيان الثغرات المحاسبية التي قد تلجأ الإدارة إلى استغلالها لممارسة أحد أشكال التلاعبات المحاسبية، إضافةً إلى توصيتهم بتبني طريقة قياس واحدة ومحددة تعتمد في السوق المالي كمؤشر على جودة الأرباح تقوم بتطبيقه جميع الشركات للتأكد من جودة أرباحها، وذلك حتى يسهل المقارنة بين الشركات.",

The researcher employed a hybrid strategy to attain this goal. Data was collected through survey questionnaires and interviews during the academic year 2020-2021. The total degree of students' perspective toward the Reading Plus book was 3.33, indicating a reasonable level of estimation, according to quantitative methodologies.

Therefore, performance increases in significance particularly during successive financial crises, most recently Covid-19, which is a complicated pandemic that affects health and financial aspects.\r\nThe study examines whether Covid19 pandemic has an impact on the relationship between the financial performance of companies in return to assets, equity, and EPS and the company value with regard to stock return, Tobin Q ratio, P/E ratio by using the multi-variable regression equation on a group of 36 companies out of 46 ones listed in the Palestine Exchange, however, ten of which were excluded due to lack of data during the period 2019-2020.\r\nThis study has also found no effect of the Covid19 pandemic on the relationship between the financial performance (ROA, ROE, EPS) and the company’s value (stock return), but it was turned out that the Covid19 pandemic had significant effect weakening the relationship between financial performance (ROA, ROE, EPS) and the company value (Tobin’s Q), and it also had a significant impact on the relationship between the financial performance (ROA, ROE) and the company's value (P/E ratio) as the results showed that the relationship is negative.\r\nThe study recommended conducting additional studies to examine the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and its impact on the economy and stock prices of companies in the Palestine Exchange to deal with future studies on the dimensions of unemployment and inflation, which is one of the most prominent consequences of the pandemic. In addition, researchers should take into account in their future research a greater sample size and a longer period of time while studying the impact of the Covid19 pandemic. It also motivates researchers to study additional mechanisms and indicators other than profitability indicators of financial performance such as debt indicators, liquidity and others.",

The sample of the  study included all companies (15 companies) listed on Al-Quds Index of the Palestine Exchange (PEX) . Two components of the value relevance were examined:  confirmatory value measured by coincident relevance and predictive value measured by forecast relevance. The data were collected from PEX website (secondary data), regression is used for analysis (the panel analysis robustness standard errors). Results of the  study indicated  that a variation in value relevance between accounting information and share prices did exist. Furthermore, the ability of earnings per share and book value of equity per share to affect market value per share was found to be higher than operating cash flow and cash dividends per share. Further, there were forecast and coincident relevance between accounting information and market value of share. However, the forecast relevance was higher than  the coincident relevance.\r\nThe study recommends that companies give more interest to earnings per share and book value of equity and their disclosures because investors largely depend on them when pricing the shares.",

The first hypothesis examined the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on stock liquidity, and outcomes of the study revealed that the relationship between female on board and stock liquidity is positive and insignificant. Furthermore, there is a positive and insignificant relationship between chief executive officer duality and stock liquidity. Additionally, there is a positive and insignificant association among inside ownership and stock liquidity. However, the association among board size and stock liquidity is negative and significant. Also, there is an inverse and insignifcant relationship between board independence  and stock liquidity. \r\nThe second hypothesis examined the relationship between corporate governance mechanisms and financial leverage, and findings of the study indicate that there is a positive relationship between board size, female on board, and inside ownership with financial leverage. Whereas, an inverse relationship has been found between board independence, and chief executive officer duality with financial leverage.\r\nThe third hypothesis examined the association between financial leverage and stock liquidity, and outcomes of the study revealed that there is an inverse and significant association between level of financial leverage and stock liquidity",

                "value": "This study aims to predict corporate failure (CF) of the companies listed on the Palestine Exchange (PEX) and the Amman Stock Exchange (ASE) by means of a statistical method, using R. In addition, the study intends to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) and board characteristics (BC) on CF. \r\nThe statistical method used in this study was survival analysis. RStudio was used to analyze the study data by applying the Cox hazard regression technique. The annual reports of a total of 96 companies from the industrial and service sectors were analyzed for the period between 2015 and 2019. More than 7200 observations were made in this study. Agency theory and upper echelons theory were the main theories used to explain the association among the study variables. The study found a significant negative association of board size, board independence, board age, board education, firm size, liquidity and profitability, considered together, and CF. \r\nIn contrast, for companies in the PEX – except for board age, which showed significant negative association with CF – there existed a significant positive association of CF with ownership concentration, board education and board activity. For ASE, there was a significant positive association between profitability and CF but a significant negative association of board size, board independence, board age, board education, firm size, liquidity and profitability with CF. \r\nIn general, the log-likelihood test result indicated that the CG and BC models are significant for the PEX and ASE. However, there was a significant difference between PEX and ASE regarding the impact of CG and BC on CF. Moreover, the statistical learning test suggested that liquidity, firm size, ownership structure, board age, board independence and profitability are the most important subset variables, in that order, to predict CF. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve illustrated that the survival models as classifiers are ideal and have an accuracy equal to 0.84. \r\nThis study is expected to contribute to the literature in the field of accounting by providing an understanding of the association between CG and BC on one hand and CF on the other. Moreover, this study statistically predicts CF without relying on commonly used quantitative models for the purpose, such as Altman, Kida and Sherrod models. In addition, this study is one of the first ones to use RStudio in the field of accounting. Finally, it links behavioural science and accounting theories. \r\nFindings assist investors to evaluate financially distressed firms on the basis of CG and BC. In addition, it will help decision-makers to improve the firm and avoiding risks that may lead CF. Also, be essential for regulatory authorities in formulating new policies regarding CG and BC. Moreover, this study is considered a model that encourages researchers to use the RStudio program in their research.\r\nThe study limitations are the difference between the size of PEX and ASE. As the size of the ASE is three times larger than the PEX. Thus, this leads to differences in the accuracy of the results, as the larger sample leads to results that are more accurate. In addition, the absence of an agreed index for evaluating CG practice compliance. Future studies are encouraged to study more factors that may be an effect on the CF especially under the influence of the Covid-19 pandemic. Another important suggestion is to use artificial intelligence in the prediction of CF in PEX and ASE.",

                "value": "هدفت هذه الدراسة للتعرف على واقع استخدام المحاسبة الابتداعية في ممارسة إدارة الأرباح في الشركات الفلسطينية المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين للأوراق المالية، واختبار مدى وجود فروق ذات دلالة إحصائية عند مستوى دلالة (α≤ 0.05)، في ممارسة أساليب المحاسبة الابتداعية تعزى لمتغيرات الدراسة المستقلة: القطاع الاقتصادي، حجم أصول الشركة، وربحية الشركة، ومديونية الشركة وحساباتها تحت التحصيل، وسيولة الشركة، والتدفقات النقدية للشركة، ونمو الشركة. وكذلك اختبار مدى وجود فروق بين القطاعات الاقتصادية المختلفة في ممارسة المحاسبة الابتداعية، وفي ممارسة إدارة الأرباح. حيث انه تم الاعتماد في هذه الدراسة على نموذج جونز المعدل، وتم تطبيق الدراسة على عينة من الشركات المساهمة العامة خلال الفترة 2010 -2015.  \r\nوقد اظهرت الدراسة ان الشركات المساهمة العامة المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين للأوراق المالية تمارس المحاسبة الابتداعية في ممارسة إدارة الأرباح بشكل عام، وقد تبين وجود تفاوت بين القطاعات الاقتصادية في درجة ممارسة إدارة الأرباح حيث تبين أن شركات القطاع الصناعي هي الاكثر ممارسة، تلاه قطاع التأمين، وقطاع الاستثمار، وقطاع الخدمات، وقطاع الأوراق المالية. وتبين وجود تفأوت في الممارسة خلال السنوات المختلفة فقد تبين أن عام 2015 شهد أكبر ممارسة من قبل الشركات المساهمة العامة حيث بلغ عدد للشركات الممارسة 16 بنسبة وصلت إلى 38.09% من إجمالي شركات العينة.\r\nوتبين أيضاً عدم وجود فروق ذات دلالة احصائية عند مستوى دلالة (α≤ 0.05)، في ممارسة أساليب المحاسبة الابتداعية تعزى لمتغيرات الدراسة المستقلة: القطاع الاقتصادي، حجم أصول الشركة، وربحية الشركة، ومديونية الشركة وحساباتها تحت التحصيل، وسيولة الشركة، والتدفقات النقدية للشركة، ونمو الشركة... الخ.  وتبين من خلال مراجعة القيم المعنوية أن المتغيرات المستقلة: حجم الأصول، وحجم الربحية، وحجم السيولة كانت ذات معنوية بدلالة القيمة المعنوية لهذه المتغيرات حيث بلغ مستوى الدلالة أقل من 0.05، وهو مستوى الدلالة المحدد في الدراسة. بينما تبين أن حجم المديونية والحسابات تحت التحصيل، والنمو في حجم الأصول لم تكن ذو دلالة إحصائية. حيث تبين ان مستوى الدلالة لها أكبر من 0.05 وهو مستوى المعنوية المحدد في هذه الدراسة. \r\nومن خلال مراجعة قيم معاملات الانحدار تبين ايضاً وجود علاقة طردية ما بين حجم الأصول وحجم ربحية الشركة، وحجم الحسابات تحت التحصيل، وحجم المديونية وممارسة المحاسبة الابتداعية. بينما تبين وجود علاقة عكسية ما بين حجم سيولة الشركة، وحجم النمو في أصول الشركة، وممارسة المحاسبة الابتداعية في الشركات المساهمة العامة المدرجة في بورصة فلسطين خلال الفترة المحددة للدراسة، وهي الفترة ما بين 2010 -2015.  \r\nوفي نهاية الدراسة بينت التوصيات ضرورة قيام الجهات الرقابية ببذل المزيد من الجهود للكشف عن عمليات ممارسة المحاسبة الابتداعية في إدارة الأرباح في الشركات الفلسطينية، والعمل على تطوير إجراءات عمل، ونظام فاعل لمحاسبة إدارة الشركات التي تقوم بمحأولات الممارسة، وضرورة الالتزام بدرجة أكبر بمتطلبات الإفصاح في البيانات المالية كالإفصاح عن أسباب تغيير الطرق المحاسبية المستخدمة في عملية القياس المحاسبي، وسياسات توزيع العوائد على المساهمين، ومكافآت وحوافز الإدارة التنفيذية العليا في الشركات المساهمة العامة الفلسطينية، وكذلك الحوافز الممنوحة لأعضاء مجالس إدارة الشركات. وتم اقتراح إجراء المزيد من البحوث والدراسات في هذا المجال.",

The sample of this study comprises of 35 companies.  \r\nIn this study, three types of variables were used: (1) dependent variables, (2) independent variables, and (3) control variables. Corporate Failure represents the dependent variable. The corporate governance variables are the independent variables. Namely, Board Size, Board Meetings' Frequency, CEO Duality, Board of Directors’’ Independency, Institutional Ownership, Quality of External Audit, Remuneration of Directors, and presence of an Audit Committee. Company-specific features such as company age, company size, and company leverage are included in the logistic regression model as control variables to avoid misspecification of the regression model.\r\nThe main results of the study indicated that there is a significant positive relationship between (Board of Directors’’ Independency, and Institutional ownership) and corporate failure. There is a significant negative relationship between the quality of external audit and the corporate failure prediction, while there is no significant relationship between (Board Size, Board Meeting's Frequency, CEO Duality, Remuneration of directors, and Audit Committee Existence) and corporate failure prediction. The results show a significant negative relationship between the control variable (Company Size) and corporate failure prediction; however, there are no significant relationships between (Company Age, Company Leverage) and corporate failure prediction.\r\nThe researcher provides many recommendations, the most important of which are: each company must appoint a lawyer to follow up on the new legislation related to the company's work.

They are identified by the return of general price index and the return of Exchange Sectors’ Indexes in particular; in order to identify different results between different sectors and markets. The macroeconomic factors represented by five variables which are; gross domestic product, balance of trade, consumer price index, exchange rate, and industrial product index. The second section of the thesis handles the   political events in the area and their impact on Palestine and Amman Stock Exchange Returns, identified by the return of general price index. This study makes use of time series based on monthly data for macroeconomic factors from January 2011, and January 2007 for the Palestinian and Jordanian markets respectively continuing to December 2017. The study applies macro-econometric model based on Arbitrage Pricing Theory, and testing these variables with unit root test, correlation coefficient, ordinary least square test, and ARCH/GARCH models. Moreover, the most seventeen important political events during the years 2011-2017 are selected and tested to show how they affect stock index return by using event study methodology in event windows of 5, 10 and 30",

                "value": "This study seeks to explore the correlation between earnings quality and share prices within the Palestine Exchange (PEX). It also examines the potential mediating role of audit quality. The sample comprises 40 companies listed on (PEX) over the period spanning 2011 to 2020, totaling 400 observations. Earnings quality was assessed through an analysis that considered factors such as cash flow, net income, and total assets, while share price was determined by referencing the annual closing prices. Similarly, audit quality was quantified by considering auditor size as a crucial indicator. The findings of the investigation reveal that, when accounting for other firm-related variables within the PEX, there is no statistically significant relationship between Earnings Quality (EQ) and Share Price (SP). Additionally, the study did not identify audit quality as a mediator in the link between earnings quality and share prices. These findings will contribute to the development of more accurate and practical methods for evaluating factors that influence share values. The significance of this study lies in its examination of the degree of influence that the Palestinian market wields over earnings and audit quality, substantiated by empirical evidence. This investigation is particularly noteworthy as it represents the pioneering effort to establish a connection between earnings quality and market share prices while shedding light on the potential mediating role of audit quality, exclusively within the Palestinian market",

                "value": "This study seeks to investigate the moderating role of corporate governance (CG) in the relationship between earnings management (EM) and debt level in capital structure of the firm (DCAPS). The annual reports of 38 firms from the manufacturing sector were analyzed for the period 2013–2020. By employing RStudio, the researcher included both fixed and random effect regressions in the analysis.\nThe overall results showed that EM improved debt ratio. Regarding the moderating role of CG, non-executive directors and female board members increased the high leverage implications of EM. \nPalestinian manufacturing firms debt levels were significantly reduced by EM. The moderating role of CG states that larger boards and female directors increase the high-leverage impact of EM, while CEO duality reduces it. However, EM had an insignificant impact on debt in Jordanian manufacturing firms. The presence of female board members increased the firm's reliance on debt financing as a result of EM practices, while institutional investors mitigated the effect of EM on debt financing, decreasing debt reliance.\nThis study anticipated to contribute to capital structure literature by explaining the link between CG and EM and CAPS. Helping decision makers and investors assess the efficacy of existing CG reforms for strengthening CAPS management, managing EM practices, monitoring procedures, and creating the optimal capital structure. This study recommends that the board of directors and management should evaluate its tolerance while making decisions, especially regarding its financial structure. Capital-structure policy should be considered when making financial decisions. Second, managers should carefully design an optimal capital structure and protect their organization from risk. Since lenders depend on CG procedures, enterprises may need to maintain a specific level of CG practices to get more debt financing. This method improves monitoring, helping firms attract superior resources. \nStudy limitations are as follows: Few CG features that may directly affect financing decisions are not included in this study. The Palestinian sample employed in this study is three times smaller than the Jordanian sample, which may have affected the conclusions. Due to small sample size and time period, the findings cannot be applied to non-manufacturing samples.\nKeywords: Capital structure, corporate governance, earnings management, Palestine exchange, Amman stock exchange",

Moreover, it seeks to clarify if this relationship is moderated by corporate governance (CG) practices. The study uses data from the financial reports and disclosures of 44 companies listed at the PEX for the 2010–2019 period. A multiple linear regression is used to test the study hypotheses. Information relevance is measured by the Ohlson model as a correlation coefficient by using three variables including earnings per share (EPS), book value per share (BV), and operating cash flow per share (OCF). CSRD, on the other hand, is measured using a disclosure index consisting of 28items, while CG is measured using four board-related characteristics as CG practices, including CEO duality, board independence, board qualification, and board size. The study revealed that 44% of companies disclose social responsibility in their annual reports, with 57% focusing on product development and customer service. 48% of them are interested in community involvement, participating in charitable activities and supporting educational institutions. 40% of them disclose human resources, as employees are considered essential to the production process and bring benefits and profit. 32% of companies call for environmental protection, with some believing it is the state's duty, the regression analysis reveals mixed results on the impact of CSRD on accounting information relevance. Three measurements, EPS, BV, and OCF, are significantly impacted by CSRD. There is a significant and positive impact of corporate governance on the relationship between CSRD and the relevance of accounting information represented by three measurement EPS, BV, and OCF. The interaction terms (CSRD*DUL) have a significant relationship with BV and OCF but are insignificant with EPS. The interaction terms (CSRD*BIND) have an insignificant relationship with both EPS and BV but a significant relationship with OCF. The interaction terms (CSRD*BQUL) have a significant relationship with EPS and OCF but an insignificant relationship with BV. The regression also shows an insignificant and positive link between CSRD*BSIZE and EPS, BV, and OCF. In light of these results, the study presented several recommendations most notably: the requirement for companies to commit to disclosing all of their efforts to promote social responsibility in their annual reports, particularly those related to the environment.\nKeywords: Relevance of Accounting Information, Corporate Social Responsibility Disclosure, Corporate Governance, Palestine Exchange",

                "value": "Securing financing for companies is a critical issue for their managements. Actually, the cost of equity (COE) is an important element in determining their financing source. COE may be influenced by voluntary disclosure (VD). Disclosing additional information could reduce information asymmetry and leads to lower risk and decrease the COE.\r\nThis study investigates the relationship between VD and the COE, from one hand. On the other hand, it also examines the moderating role of corporate governance (CG) on the association between VD and the COE.\r\nRelevant measures were used in this study to achieve its objectives. Voluntary disclosure was measured by developing a checklist based on the extant literature and the prevailing circumstances in Palestine. The Capital Assets Pricing Model (CAPM) framework and the profitability ratio (ROE) were used to measure the COEC. CAPM was employed through using three models including the classical CAPM model (COE 1), Standard Deviation of return (COE 2), and Semi-\r\ndeviation of return (COE 3). Furthermore, the profitability was measured by return on equity (ROE) twice. In the first (ROE1), the classical return on equity, which is measured by dividing the net income of the firm by its total book value of equity, was used. Since ROE can have negative values but the COE can never be negative, an additional measure of the COE is used where all negative values are set to zero (ROE2). Moreover, a second checklist was also developed to measure the moderating variable (CG).\r\nData was obtained mainly from the annual reports prepared by the companies listed on Palestine Exchange (PEX) for ten years from 2009 to 2018. Forty-one companies listed in the PEX were considered in this study after excluding the banking sector. Financial and non-financial panel data (longitudinal data) was collected; it includes cross-sectional and time-series data.\r\nThe regression results indicate that the most significant results emerged when using CAPM- downside risk (COE 3). This can be explained as beta (COE 1) is not proper to estimate risk in emerging markets. Moreover, investors don't avoid favorable volatility (COE 2); they just avoid downside or unfavorable volatility that can be measured by the semi deviation.\r\nOur findings highlight a negative and significant relationship between voluntary disclosure and cost of equity (COE 3), confirming the research hypothesis. The results also provide evidence when used (ROE1 and ROE2) indicates that CG moderates the associations between VD and COE since a negative and significant relationship between both variables exist only under commitment to good corporate governance mechanisms.\r\nThe study suggests a set of recommendations, including the manger should use a proper measure for cost of equity when take financing decision,.and managers must pay more attention to disclosure and, in particular, must increase the quality of voluntary disclosure through commitment to good corporate governance practice.",
